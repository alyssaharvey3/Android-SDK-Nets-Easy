# README #

This is a repository containing the react native wrapper for Mia iOS and Android SDKs.

- [Sample App](#sample-app)
- [Integration](#integration)
- [Usage (Access Mia API)](#usage-(access-mia-api))
- [Mia Checkout API](#mia-checkout-api)
- [Example (Create Payment with EASY)](#example-(create-payment-with-easy))

## Sample App 

To get started with the sample app, clone this repository and: 

1. Navigate to MiaSample folder (`cd MiaSample`) and install dependencies: `yarn install`
	
2. Add `react-native-rn-mia` to the sample app: `yarn add ./../react-native-rn-mia`

	- For iOS, navigate to the ios folder and install pods: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
	
3. Run the application 

	- iOS: `react-native run-ios` or open MiaSample.xcworkspace and run the application 
	
	- Android: `react-native run-android` or open the android folder with an IDE and run the application
	
Note: Make sure to start the 'Metro server' with `react-native start` command if your IDE fails to run the application.  
	

## Integration

Along with the sample app, the repository contains our react native wrapper module.
In order to integrate this module in your project: 

* Add the module dependency using yarn/npm: `yarn add ./../react-native-rn-mia`

This links the module in Android and iOS automatically. 

In iOS, the `Mia.xcframework` supported starting *MiaSDK 1.3* allows for auto-linking using Xcode 12.3 and above version. If an older version of the SDK is used (<MiaSDK 1.3 `Mia.framework`), the following steps are required to complete the *iOS* integration.

* iOS manual steps: Open your application xcworkspace and add Mia.framework to the Libraries folder
	- Right click on Libraries - Add Files to "Your project" and find Mia.framework in *react-native-rn-mia/ios* directory
	- Under application target - *Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content*, select *Embed & Sign* for Mia.framework
	
## Usage (Access Mia API)

The react native wrapper module can be accessed from your javascript by importing RNMia module. 
```js
import RNMia from 'react-native-rn-mia';
```

### Mia Checkout API

Present Mia checkout after obtaining a payment ID and payment URL from EASY `create payment` REST API.
See the [example](### Example - Create Payment with EASY) to create payment with order and merchant details.

```js
// This example presents Mia SDK's checkout WebView and handles 
// the callbacks by presenting an alert accordingly
RNMia.checkoutWithPaymentID(paymentID, paymentURL, redirectURL, cancelURL
(error) => {
   alertTitle = error ? "Error" : "Payment Successful"
   Alert.alert(alertTitle, error, [{text:"Ok"}])
}, 
(cancellation) => {
   Alert.alert("Cancelled", "You have cancelled the payment", [{text:"Ok"}])
});
```

Note: A redirect URL is used to identify navigation from Mia SDK back to the application.
Pass the same `redirectURL` when creating the payment with Easy API and 
when presenting checkout with Mia SDK as shown above. 

Callbacks:
	- Success: The first callback is invoked with no `error` if payment was successful
	- Failure: The first callback returns an `error` map object in case of error. User "Error" key to obtain error message. 
	- Cancellation: The second callback is invoked if the user cancelled the process. The callback does not contain any argument. 

### Example (Create Payment with EASY)

Create the request body:

```js 
requestBody = {
	"checkout": {
		"termsUrl": URL,
		"returnURL": redirectURL,
		"consumerType": {
			"supportedTypes": [
		    	"B2C",
		        "B2B"
		     ],
		    "default": "B2C"
		},
		"integrationType": "HostedPaymentPage"
	},
	"order": {
		"reference": "reference",
		"currency": "SEK",
        "amount": amount,
		"items": [
			{
		    	"unit": "pcs",
		        "netTotalAmount": amount,
		        "taxAmount": 0,
		        "grossTotalAmount": amount,
	            "quantity": 1,
	            "name": "Lightning Cable",
				"unitPrice": amount,
		        "taxRate": 0,
		        "reference": "reference"
	         }
		]
	},
}
```

Initiate payment using your merchant secret key to authorize with EASY

```js 
// Test env. is used for this demo
baseURL = "https://test.api.dibspayment.eu/v1/"
fetch(baseURL + '/payments', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		'Authorization': 'Token ' + secretKey
	},
	body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
})
.then((response) => response.json())
.then((json) => {

	// Use these `paymentID` and `paymentURL` to present Mia SDK (see above)
	paymentID = json.paymentId 
    paymentURL = json.hostedPaymentPageUrl  
	
})
.catch((error) => {
	console.error(error);
});
```

Mia SDK presents a checkout WebView with the payment information and returns 
the result to the application via callbacks.

In order to initiate a subscription payment, include a `subscription` key in the request body 
containing `endDate` and `interval` values. See EasyAPI.js of the sample app for a complete example.
